# Microsoft .NET Core ---> came into market-2016. It is free open source also, created for building modern Cloud based Apps. Platform Independent.
->cross platform development - runs on various OS.
->Open source software - public collaboration and made freely available.
->fast development.
->It is based on MVC(Model View Controller).


-----------------------------------------------------*ASP.NET Core*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
->is new version of ASP.NET , an improved one with richer functionality, new libraries.
->consist of modular components with minimal overhead.
->latest version is Core 7.0 .
->It has robust Cloud support, supports modular architecture(separate modules) better than ASP. Net does.
->web framework.
->Runs on Dot Net and Dot Net Core framework.
_>No webforms.
_>control over no of dependencies.
appsettings.json -> configuration and settings in this.
->powerful isolation algorithms.

[ASP.NET, first version in 2002  based on .NET framework platform based on HTTP Protocol for req and communication, only on Windows, support webforms, More dependencies, low level of isolation].


---------------------------------------------------------------**MVC**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MVC is a design pattern inside ASP and it is used when we design an app.
->provide SOC(separation of concern),work in separate modules.  
Three Basic Components:
1. Model (Business Entities)-> makes different entities in database and represent
2. View (Presentation Logic)-> UI work is done here
3. Controller(Business Logic)-> important logic written and act as bridge between model and view and establish communication between them.

->User can only see View not the other two. whenever User sent request, it will go to Controller and if data is in Model then that data is update in VIEW by Controller and then that data will be display to user.

**DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF MVC:-
Dependencies-> pre installed libraries and frameworks.
Properties-> launchsettings.json file, contains setting that control how web app is started on machine. only used within local development machine(pc, laptop). 
wwwroot-> store static files like image files, bootstrap files, css files.

appsettings.json file->is an app configuration file used to store configure setting such as database connections string etc.

program.cs-> first file to run. Middleware is used here.

--------------**MIDDLEWARE**-------:
any request done by client passed through middleware then goes to web api and then it respond. It is executed in every request and it controls how ->app responds to HTTP requests.
->It also control how our app looks when there is an error.
->authentication and authorization.
->order of middleware is important.
app.Run(async (context)-> never call subsequent middleware.
app.Use(async (context, next) )-> have call next middleware also and can write code after that in same middleware also.

--------------**ROUTING**---------:
It is a mechanism in which it will inspect the incoming requests and then mapped the request to controllers and their action methods.
ROUTING = URL + HTTPS Methods.
Two ways for defining routes:-
1.Convention based routing-> defining pattern.
route is determined based on conventions defined in route templates which will map incoming request to controllers and their action methods.
It is defined in program.cs file.
"{controller=  }/{action= }/{id?}"

2. Attribute based routing-> [Route] attribute is used to define the routes.
route is determined based on attribute which are configure either at controller level or at action level.
changing their names does not require route template to be changed.
Tokens are [controller] and [action].

Methods:
1. Map-> work with any get, post, update, delete(same).
2. MapGet-> work only with get method.
3. MapPost 4. MapPut 5. MapDelete
------------------------------**ENTITY FRAMEWORK CORE**------------------------
->new version after EF6 but it is redesigned.
->ORM: Object Relational Mapping Framework. to address data access requirements of ASP.NET CORE MVC apps. it is a tool used to store data in relational databases.
Here, Entity framework core is the framework used in bw objects and database.
->open-source, lightweight, extensible and cross-platform.
->a data access technology.
->automated mechanism.

CLASSES(in apps)---> ORM----> Database.(First approach)
ORM convert model classes and generate tables in databases.

It supports two development approaches:
1. Code-First:
Existing Model class -> Code First -> Generated DB/Tables
->It allows you to define your own model by creating custom classes.
->model class + Db Context Class -> Migration --(Run)--> Database tables 
[----for adding migration -> dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate]
[-----uodating database - dotnet ef database update]

*CSRF - form hidden field applied by asp dot net core to prevent from attack.*

2. Database-First:

Existing Database & tables -> DB First -> Generated Model Classes.

**SCAFFOLDING FOR CRUD OPERATIONS-->>
->Scaffolding in ASP.NET Core is a powerful feature that automatically generates the code for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations based on your data model. This can save a lot of time and effort when developing applications.
Steps:
1.Create a new ASP.NET Core Project
2.Installed required packages: use NuGet Package Manager Console.
3.Create Data Model.
4.Create DB Context-> to manage database connection and entity sets.
5.Configure DB Connections-> in appsettings.json
In Program.cs , configure dB Context.

**HTTP VERBS-->>
HTTP verbs, also known as HTTP methods, define the actions that can be performed on resources in a web application.
Here are the most commonly used HTTP verbs:
1.GET-> retrieve data from the server. ex: GET.products
2.POST: submit data to server to create new resource. ex: creating a new product.
3.PUT: update a product details.
4.DELETE: ex: DELETE/products/1
5.PATCH: apply partial modification to resource.

**DATA ANNOTATION**->Data annotations in ASP.NET are used to define validation rules directly within your model classes.
Common attributes include:
[Required]: Ensures that a field is not left empty.
[StringLength]: Sets the maximum length of a string.
[Range]: Specifies a range for numeric values.
[EmailAddress]: Validates that the field contains a valid email address.
->All attribute should be under namespace -> System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations

**DATA VALIDATION**->Data validation in ASP.NET can be performed using these annotations. When a user submits a form, the framework automatically checks the data against the defined rules. If the data doesn't meet the criteria, validation errors are generated.
Example:-
public class User
{
    [Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [EmailAddress]
    public string Email { get; set; }

    [Range(18, 100)]
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
